# Implementation Plan for Elasticsearch Search Service

I will develop a robust Elasticsearch search service using Spring Boot to enable advanced document search capabilities in data-intensive applications. I will use Elasticsearch as the search engine for efficient full-text search and document indexing. I will structure the application following a layered architecture (Controller-Service-Repository) to maintain separation of concerns and code clarity.

I will create the document model (`SearchableDocument`) with appropriate Elasticsearch annotations to configure field mappings, analyzers, and index settings. I will implement a flexible search request model (`SearchRequest`) with validation constraints to handle query parameters, filtering, sorting, and pagination. I will design a comprehensive search response model (`SearchResponse`) that provides search results with metadata including pagination details and execution time.

I will build the core search functionality in `SearchServiceImpl` to translate search requests into Elasticsearch queries and process results. I will implement health monitoring capabilities to check Elasticsearch connection and index status. I will expose REST endpoints in `SearchController` for executing searches and checking system health, with proper input validation and logging.

I will configure security using Spring Security to protect the API endpoints, with different security rules for search and health monitoring. I will implement comprehensive error handling through a global exception handler (`GlobalExceptionHandler`) to provide structured error responses for Elasticsearch errors, validation issues, and server errors.

For development and testing purposes, I will create utilities (`SearchDataGenerator` and `SearchDataInitializer`) to generate and load sample documents. I will write unit tests for all components using Mockito and JUnit 5, and integration tests to verify the actual interaction with Elasticsearch. I will ensure all classes and methods are properly documented with meaningful comments to enhance maintainability.

Finally, I will configure appropriate logging throughout the application to capture important events and troubleshooting information while being mindful of performance impact. I will ensure the application is properly configured for different environments (development, test, production) with appropriate settings.
